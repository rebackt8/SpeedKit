# SpeedKit
Coming Soon to GitHub.  A JavaScript/PHP library that will allow webpages to run efficiently without refreshing the page or navigating away to other pages.  Uses XMLHttpRequests, DocumentFragments, and other Javascript APIs to store and spontaneously load new content and place it on the page, loading the bare minimum from the server.

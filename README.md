# SpeedKit
Coming Soon to GitHub!!

A JavaScript/PHP library that will allow webpages to run efficiently without refreshing the page or navigating away to other pages.  Uses XMLHttpRequests, DocumentFragments, and other Javascript APIs to store and spontaneously load new content and place it on the page, loading the bare minimum from the server.  Will also provide very lightweight scripts for handling modern web-features (Parsing Emoji's, Encrypting/Decrypting, Building a Login Form, Querying External Web API's, An Admin Dashboard for Emailing, etc.)

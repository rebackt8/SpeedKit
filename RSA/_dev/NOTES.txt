The JSEncrypt algorithm is extremely messy and inefficient.
Goal:  Rewrite the algorithm starting from the basics, then adding the following:
	b64 String->Integer conversion, then Integer->b64 String
	Prime Number generator
	Random Factors
	Big Integer handler, with add, subtract, mult., divide...etc.
	Key sizes, build 512, then if works, build 1024...4096...
